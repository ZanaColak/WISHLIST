# WISHLIST

## Welcome to Wishlist

This application is our implementation of a website which handles the simple CRUD methods as: creating a user, one wishlists and adding 
items to said wishlists. You can update and delete these as well. 
The appeal of our application is that you can make a wishlist for anything. 
You can also enter a URL (like from Google) under an item to indicate what the item specifically is.

The tools we used for this project:
- Mysql 
- Dependencies in Spring Boot: Spring Web, Thymeleaf and Mysql Connector.
- Docker Container
- Bootstrap for design
