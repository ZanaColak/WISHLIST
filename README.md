# WISHLIST

## Welcome to Wishlist

This application is our implementation of a website which handles the simple CRUD methods as: creating a user, one wishlists and adding 
items to a given wishlists. You can update and delete these as well. 
The appeal of our application is that you can make a wishlist for anything. 
You can also enter a URL (like from Google) under an item to indicate what the item specifically is.

In this project, we have used a feasibility study that examines all aspects of this project which is including technical, economic, legal, operational and scheduling considerations.
