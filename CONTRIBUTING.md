# Welcome to WISHLIST

## About the project

This project revolves around a wishlist system which can be anything the user would like. 
It is purposely designed to be a generic wishlist, so it can be used for any type of list.

## About the application

The application uses MySQL as a backend database in order to insert new information to save it for later.
We've used JDBC in order to handle this data so naturally we also made use of Springboot.
Because of this we use Thymeleaf as API to display data on HTML pages together with Bootstrap as Front-end framework.

## Difficulties

Unfortunately in its current state the application is lacking functionality such as correctly adding a user,
create a wishlist under said user's account and let the user add items to the wishlist. 
We've faced innumerable technical difficulties which have wasted precious time, 
so our group did not manage to fully implement the functions of the application in time.
